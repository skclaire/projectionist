    <h6>ABOUT THE FEATURE</h6>
    <p>
Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan are an inseparable pair, but that wasn’t always the case. From the moment these two mismatched monsters met they couldn’t stand each other. <b>Monsters University</b> unlocks the door to how Mike and Sulley overcame their differences and became the best of friends.

      <p>
Hi, everyone! Dan Scanlon here, and I’m excited to share our next film, Monsters University, with you. I am pleased to present to you the labor of love that has occupied our hearts and our minds for the past four years. At Pixar, we go to great lengths to make sure that the characters, story, sound and picture are as perfect as possible. Our standards are high and our audiences have come to expect a wonderful experience when they see a Pixar film. We think of you as an extended part of the Pixar family. We appreciate that your standards for presenting Monsters University are just as high, and we know that you love giving audiences a perfect presentation.</p>
<p>
You are our gatekeepers of quality. Please take the time to run through the movie before your first screening to be sure the picture looks bright and vibrant, and the audio levels are properly set. I count on you to help me bring my film to the audience in the best way possible.</p>

      <h6>PERFECT PROJECTION</h6>
      <p>
At Disney·Pixar, we know that all of our creative effort in making a film pours through the lens from the projection booth, and is shown to audiences on a giant movie screen. No amount of attention during the production is more important than that of the projectionist, who, with care and precision, shows the movie to the theater’s waiting guests. Bad projection can spoil years of work that were put into the making of the movie. Perfect Projection literally makes it shine, and causes audiences to come back for more.</p>
<p>
We at Pixar recognize the essential part that technicians and projectionists play in presenting our movies to the public, and want to provide help to make it perfect.</p>
